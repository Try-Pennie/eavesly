[handling agent]: So when it shows closed, that's why clients are able to get that settlement. After you get the settlement within your term, it shows settled and paid. So it's the same thing like if you paid off your old account on your credit report. Like, a good 1 would be you had a Best Buy account. That account on your credit report shows paid and closed. Anytime someone pays off a debt, whether they do it themselves or in a program, it'll always reflect how you paid it, and that's what helps the creditworthiness go up.
[contact]: He said he said that they were gonna say that it's it's closed and that there wasn't gonna be, not gonna be showing that I haven't paid on them each month.
[transfer agent]: No. What happens is you have to stop paying the creditors now because the creditors require a period of 3 to 6 months of nonpayments on the account consecutively. So you will show missed payments at least for that long, if not longer. And that's what affects the credit.
[contact]: that's not what he told me. He told me something completely different.
[handling agent]: I have the representative on the phone. He's gonna make sure you have your phone number. I'll leave you in in good hands, and you take care.
[contact]: Bye.
