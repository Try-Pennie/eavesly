[contact]: Hello?
[handling agent]: Hey, Chris. This is Jonathan with Penny on a recorded line. I had you on the count call.
[contact]: Hello?
[handling agent]: How's your day going so far?
[contact]: Good. How about you?
[handling agent]: Oh, very well. Always a fine day. Very busy, of course, as usual. But glad to reconnect with you. I know you've been kinda looking at options.
[handling agent]: You're did you get a chance to just review that, like, screen clip I I sent you?
[contact]: I did. Yeah.
[handling agent]: So yeah. Yeah. Like, just first or foremost, any any, like, specific questions or or anything that I can recap for you from what what we've been over?
[contact]: Now I think my biggest question was so because I know there are some credit cards that I have that don't have a 0 that have a 0 balance on them. Are those getting closed as well?
[handling agent]: That have a 0 balance?
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: So any anything not included is not just gonna yeah. They're they're not gonna be reaching out. So those are not included. They they wouldn't be involved in any of this. So, generally, they they wouldn't just close accounts if they're not well, it it kinda depends.
[handling agent]: So, like, if you have, like, a let me let me pull up your file. If you have, like, a Chase card in the program and you have a Chase card with a 0 balance, Chase is likely to close that other account. Does that make sense? So,
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: but let me just grab your file here so I can review over it. But, yeah, that that's kinda the only exception to that.
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: So it's, yeah, it's kinda like the 1 creditor is gonna say, well, if we're negotiating this 1, we're not gonna let you charge the other 1 that you have with us. Does that make sense?
[contact]: Which makes sense. No. I mean, that makes perfect sense. So
[handling agent]: And then also just because we haven't spoke in 30 days, just for security, can you please verify date of birth and last 4 of the social?
[contact]: 102785, and it's 1299.
[handling agent]: Okay. Thank you for that. And then also, like, the numbers we looked at, same thing. Like, the the quote has technically expired because it's been more than 30 days. If we do, like, a soft check, we can kinda, like, re relook at it.
[handling agent]: Is it okay if we do that? This will give us, like, the what the current numbers are. It shouldn't it shouldn't be off too much, but is that okay?
[contact]: Sure.
[handling agent]: Thank you. This just will enable me because it expires on my end too. So I'm trying to see exactly what your your creditors are again. I I don't I can kinda go back, but but, yeah, I mean, you've been kinda looking for loan options. Like, if you applied for other loans since we last spoke about, like, 30 ago.
[contact]: No. No. I haven't applied for any of those. I was just trying to figure out how talk to other people and figure out what I wanna do.
[handling agent]: Okay. Well, I I am seeing that it it looks like the balances have gone up a little bit. So when I originally talked to you, the quote's $66,006.31. Now the credit report is showing me $70,004.30. So it does look like, you know, that's been an extra uptick there, about $3,500.
[handling agent]: So it does look like it's escalating. Don't shoot the messenger. Right? I'm just kinda letting you know that the total balances have
[contact]: Yeah.
[handling agent]: increased. So I would say that, yeah, absolutely, this would be more practical at this point to kinda break that cycle of borrowing. Does that make sense?
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: So looking at it, like, what I see paid off, like so you have a Capital 1 for about $8,200. Actually, you got 3 Capital Ones, and then you do have 1 paid off. They don't always close that 1. I'm gonna give it, like, $50.50, but that's that's kind of the example. So, like, since you would have 3 accounts that you would be revolving with balances, that fourth 1 at a 0, they are likely to close that 1, Capital 1.
[handling agent]: Does that make sense?
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: But then you have, like, Credit 1. 1 of them is open. No. I'm sorry. Credit 1 is Commerce Bank is open.
[handling agent]: Comenity Capital, which is different than Capital 1. So I I am seeing, like, Citibank. So kinda the same thing. But, look, I I know that can make you feel a little anxious. Right?
[handling agent]: But the the goal of this is just to free up the cash flow. So, like, if you're saving 1000 a month, right, that's gonna be $12,000 over 12 months cash back in your pocket. Sometimes that's greater than, like, the available credit, and I think that is the case here. So it's not you're not necessarily putting yourself in a worse position if things come up. Does that make sense?
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: But I'm just doing the math right now.
[contact]: And then
[handling agent]: Mhmm.
[contact]: so, like, I would basically let everything go delinquent. Is that correct? And then you guys settle with the creditor?
[handling agent]: Effectively correct.
[contact]: K.
[handling agent]: So, yeah, I'd like to kinda review the timeline. So on average, it's months 3 to 6 that the negotiators are starting to lock in new terms. Okay? So in that initial time frame, the credit score will go down. However, remember, there's 2 sides of the coin, payment history, spending history.
[handling agent]: So although you are missing some payments, this does enable you to drive down the balances a lot faster, which can actually just improve the other ratios, like debt to income ratio, debt to credit ratio a lot faster. And that's where you're gonna be, like, ironically enough, it can actually make your credit in a better position faster than trying to dig through all the interest. Does that make sense? I know
[contact]: Yeah. Yes.
[handling agent]: it doesn't feel like it, and it's not gonna look like that. Like, if you look at your credit report within 6 months, it's definitely not gonna appear like it's resolving that quickly. But we're talking, like, 24, 30 months from now, you're gonna have most of this already paid off. So, that's gonna be the good news. But I did I did just send you the new link.
[handling agent]: It's a Skylink again. This way, I can kinda show you
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: the updated numbers.
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: Are you able to open
[contact]: Yep. I got it.
[handling agent]: If you click on that, it'll say presentation is paused. Do you see that?
[contact]: Yeah.
[contact]: Trying to do it on my phone.
[handling agent]: Okay.
[contact]: Hold on. It went back.
[handling agent]: Total. So we still have
[contact]: Yep.
[handling agent]: I think it's still showing the original well, here here here is, like, the new kinda breakdown of, like, DTI total debt. You'll see this is, like, 70,000 here. Pay down schedule. I think we've already reviewed this stuff. We we did we did acquire you a loan option, it looks like.
[handling agent]: You did have a preapproval for about $4,600, but that's not really. So can can you see that on your screen? Do you see where the loan offer was?
[contact]: Yes. Yes.
[handling agent]: So we we did we did get you in some offers, but, yeah, obviously, that's not gonna be enough to fix this situation. So here here is the updated plan. So like I said, I I I'm not sure which account went up, but it was at 66,000. Now it's at about 7. So it it went up about $3,000 in the last 30 days.
[handling agent]: So it's definitely snowballing. But the monthly payments right now, you should see a 2,300 a month, and then the program payment would be $4.81 biweekly, which would represent a diff
[contact]: So how
[handling agent]: mhmm.
[contact]: how accurate would that payment is there a chance that that payment would increase?
[handling agent]: There's no no possibility of the payment increasing unless you opted in for it. You can always increase it on your end, but they're they're just gonna set that payment. This is based on a lot of data. So, like, without exaggeration, most of your debt looks like it's with Chase. That is actually the biggest credit card company in the country.
[handling agent]: So the negotiators handle the highest volume with Chase. So we're talking, like, at this point, I mean, they resolved billions of dollars with these companies over the years. So they they create that payment
[contact]: Yeah.
[handling agent]: based on your specific creditors and balances. So it's it's based on that historical data of working with these accounts. So for sure, the payment's not gonna go up. If anything, it's like a worst case scenario.
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: So on average, they're able to negotiate a 50%
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: reduced payoff. There are times that it will be more than that. They're just not gonna quote you on that. The reason why is because this does ensure, like, for that exact reason that your payment is more than sufficient. Right?
[handling agent]: There's no reason for it to go up because they're kind of already quoting you on, like, the the least amount of savings on the account. So this way, if the any accounts do come back better than what they're quoting you, those terms will be reduced. Right? It could go from 55 months to, like, 50 months, for example, if they're able to just negotiate better. So now you can always add more to it as you go.
[handling agent]: If you would like, you can certainly accelerate the payoff, but that will be up to you to just kinda at your discretion when you can add more. Most people just use a tax return and dump, like, a few grand on it every year. That's gonna really reduce the payments as well. Does that make sense?
[contact]: It does.
[handling agent]: But
[contact]: But that I think that was also kind of my biggest worry, and that's why I think I asked if there was a
[handling agent]: mhmm.
[contact]: loan because I didn't want it to say, hey. Your payment's gonna be $900. But then we go through it, and then it's like, oh, wait. No. It's not.
[contact]: Now it's gonna be 1,300.
[handling agent]: Yeah. Absolutely. Well, sometimes I can make a mistake. So let me just double check my numbers, which I'm gonna just do now. Nope.
[handling agent]: Nope. Everything everything is good. I don't see everything's eligible. That is included on here. Payment should not go up.
[handling agent]: That would be including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5678910 accounts. I'll send you the list of accounts right now. Negotiators do have service fee that's already built into the payment as well, so you you are looking at the bottom line on the figures there. So that should be all accurate. Again, if anything, more often than not, they are able to acquire additional savings from this quote here.
[handling agent]: So that's the good news. Again, it is just an estimate. So they're not officially quoting you on better than 50%. But like I said, it's definitely, something that happens often that they do acquire additional savings from what they quote you, but that's that's that's why they do it this way. They make sure that your payment will never need to go up.
[handling agent]: They're using that to set up the payments based on the creditors aren't gonna know what your program payment is. Right? But they are simply using this pay schedule to be able to lock in those terms. But I did, I did send you just a list of creditors so you can see all of those balances where that 70,000 is adding up to. And then, yeah, any any questions about, like, any service fees or anything like that?
[contact]: No. I don't think so.
[handling agent]: Okay.
[contact]: And, I mean, it all it all makes sense.
[handling agent]: Absolutely. And I I get it. It's not the most comfortable process, like, stopping the payments. I totally understand your there's always gonna be some anxiety, like, moving forward with this. But what I can assure you, if you just stay the course here over these first several months, you will see it work.
[handling agent]: It will make sense. If you just stick with it over the next 12 months, you know, the credit score should have started going up, by then, and, like, you'll you'll see it all work. But, unfortunately, with these things, you know, it's always a marathon, not a sprint. It is just 1 month at a time. So I always emphasize that because I think is that that is, like, the hardest part for anybody, especially in today's modern world.
[handling agent]: You know, I I go on my phone, I click a button, and there's stuff on my doorstep. I haven't even talked to a person. It's so fast. The
[contact]: Mhmm.
[handling agent]: next day and then now Amazon
[contact]: Yeah.
[handling agent]: Amazon, I order something. It's there at 5AM. I'm like, that's insane. But with with this with this, it is just you know, it's 1 month at a time. And so you just have to have that expectation moving forward.
[handling agent]: Like, it's it's all gonna be fine. It's all gonna get resolved. It's all gonna be paid. Credit will eventually be fine, but it's just gotta have that patience. That makes sense?
[handling agent]: But I would be happy to put this in black and white for you if you're ready to start putting this debt behind you. The next steps are pretty simple. It's just scheduling a program payment. How how does your pay cycle work? Like, you get paid, like, every other Friday, this Friday, next Friday, next Tuesday?
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: How how does your your pay cycle work?
[contact]: I get paid every other Thursday
[handling agent]: Is that today, next week?
[contact]: starting next week.
[handling agent]: So if you got any other payments due for February, you can just already start putting that money back in your pocket. And then so for the month of February, it would just be the 1 biweekly of $4.81 for next week on the nineteenth would be your next pay cycle, and then it would just kick over every 2 weeks after that. Does that work for you?
[contact]: Let me talk to my wife a little bit
[handling agent]: Okay.
[contact]: and make sure that that's something that we wanna move forward. That's why we had some questions. That's why I wanted to reach out again
[handling agent]: Okay.
[contact]: and see if that's what we wanna do.
[handling agent]: Okay. So you guys haven't had a chance to, like, cover that quite yet?
[contact]: No. I wanna we wanted to I wanted to ask questions, and I was gonna talk to her
[handling agent]: Okay.
[contact]: about everything and all the answers and everything.
[handling agent]: Right on. What what other questions do you have so far? Like, anything else we can clarify? Like, report,
[contact]: I don't think so.
[handling agent]: just timelines.
[contact]: I
[contact]: don't think so.
[handling agent]: Okay. Well, I I'm not in the office tomorrow. I'm back on Saturday. Do you do you wanna book another call for Saturday?
[contact]: I can't Saturday. I'm usually busy all day Saturday.
[handling agent]: Okay.
[contact]: Maybe I'm trying to think. What about Tuesday?
[handling agent]: I mean, what whatever day works for you is fine by me, you know, as long as like I once you commit to this, you just wanna stay the course. That's really, like, the main thing here. But, yeah, I would say, like, DTI. I yeah. I mean, like I said, it's not it's not the most comfortable thing right now, but I think you just kinda gotta do what you gotta do, right, on this 1.
[handling agent]: So does your spouse also have
[contact]: Yeah.
[handling agent]: additional debt?
[contact]: She doesn't have much. Most of it isn't mine.
[handling agent]: Okay. So I just sent you the proposal again. That link will expire after 72 hours. So
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: just FYI, but then I'm just same thing. I'm just gonna screen clip. So, like like I said, the debt did increase from the last the last quote I sent. So we're just gonna give you the most recent 1 this way. If if that link expires, here is just the screenshot of, basically, the proposal there.
[handling agent]: So, what what's usually a good time for you on Tuesday?
[contact]: Anytime on Tuesday because I'm off work, actually. So
[handling agent]: I can give you a call 11AM, Tuesday.
[contact]: that
[contact]: works.
[handling agent]: And you're eastern. Correct?
[contact]: Yes.
[handling agent]: Okay. I've got you on the calendar. You will get a text message reminder on that. And then But okay. You're you're on the calendar.
[handling agent]: Any any other questions before I let you go?
[contact]: I don't think so.
[handling agent]: Okay. Anything else comes up, just shoot me a text on the same loop here. I will reply to that
[contact]: Okay.
[handling agent]: for sure. And then
[contact]: Alrighty.
[handling agent]: last thing I will do, just again, you some reassurance, I'll send you our negotiator's reviews. So this will give you peace of mind. I mean, you can't please everybody. You're gonna see, like you know, if you just go right to the 1 stars, you know, you're gonna see, like, they're a scam. I don't know why people say that they're they have over 1,500 reviews on the Better Business Bureau.
[handling agent]: So thousands of 5 star reviews, people all giving positive feedback and you know? So so you're you're gonna be fine. There I mean, there's nothing new under the sun. This has been going on for 50 years, so it's really you're just plugging yourself into the equation on this 1. It's a tried and true method here to get you out of debt, but I just sent you that review link.
[handling agent]: So that should help a little bit there. So check that out. And then, yeah, I'll I'll be here, and I I've got you on the calendar for Tuesday. Okay?
[contact]: Alright. Sounds good. Thank you.
[handling agent]: Alright, Chris. My pleasure. You have a great rest of your weekend.
[contact]: Bye.
[handling agent]: Bye.
[contact]: You
